If you are looking at this code, There are a few things I'd like to tell you:

First off, the code was written in a weekend, and was made intentionally as quickly as possible,
which translates to horrible structure, bad indenting, and tons of weird variable names. 

Bascially...

This Code is disgusting.

I wouldn't use it.

If you still are going to use it though, please please please email me at isaaclandoncohen@gmail.com to tell me which part you want to use. I can try cleaning up a specific part for you, but don't want to spend time cleaning up an entire project that was made intentionally as a jam / sketch.

Also, these files are *slightly* better than the rest:
 
  -Audio.js
  -AudioController.js
  -Loading.js
  -Note.js
  -Stream.js
  -MouseMoveControls.js
  -TextCreator.js

Just because they are taken from a different project...


Also, everything cool you see probably comes from another project, so check out the 'info button'

I love you.
